# Initia Protocol v1 — Governance Signaling Specification

## 1. Purpose

Governance in Initia Protocol v1 exists **solely as a signaling and validation layer**.

Its purpose is to:
- surface collective sentiment,
- document social consensus,
- coordinate future protocol research or versions,
- and provide transparency without control.

Governance has **no execution authority** over protocol behavior.

---

## 2. Non-Authority Principle

Governance **cannot**:
- mint tokens,
- alter minting rules,
- upgrade contracts,
- pause protocol execution,
- censor participants,
- reverse transactions.

All on-chain behavior in Initia v1 is **immutable and deterministic**.

Governance signals are **non-binding** and **non-executable**.

---

## 3. Scope of Governance Signals

Governance signaling may address:

- perceived protocol health
- recommendations for future protocol versions
- social norms and best practices
- research directions
- community risk awareness
- documentation updates
- ecosystem coordination

Governance signals **do not** apply retroactively.

---

## 4. Signaling Cadence

Governance operates on a **weekly cycle**.

Each cycle includes:
1. Signal submission period
2. Signal aggregation
3. Public archival

No urgency mechanisms or emergency votes exist in v1.

---

## 5. Signal Types

Governance signals may include:

### 5.1 Informational Signals
- Observations
- Risk disclosures
- Analytics summaries

### 5.2 Recommendation Signals
- Suggestions for v2 changes
- Parameter experiments (future-only)
- Research proposals

### 5.3 Validation Signals
- Community confidence markers
- Alignment statements
- Social consensus indicators

---

## 6. Signal Submission

Any participant **may submit a signal**.

Signals:
- are off-chain
- are timestamped
- are publicly visible
- include a structured template:
  - signal type
  - rationale
  - supporting data (optional)
  - intended audience

Spam resistance is handled socially, not technically.

---

## 7. Signal Weighting

Governance signals **do not directly affect the protocol**.

Optional, non-binding weighting methods may include:
- token-weighted sentiment
- identity-weighted sentiment
- equal-weight aggregation

All weighting is **interpretive**, not authoritative.

---

## 8. Transparency & Archival

All governance signals:
- are publicly archived
- remain immutable once published
- are referenceable by future protocol versions

No deletion or redaction mechanisms exist.

---

## 9. Governance Capture Resistance

Governance is intentionally limited to:
- prevent coercion,
- reduce incentive for bribery,
- minimize power accumulation.

Because governance cannot enforce outcomes,
capture yields minimal benefit.

---

## 10. Relationship to Future Versions

Governance signals may inform:
- Initia Protocol v2+
- alternative implementations
- ecosystem tools

Future versions may choose to:
- ignore,
- partially adopt,
- or fully redesign governance mechanisms.

Initia v1 governance signals carry **no forward guarantees**.

---

## 11. User Safety Notice

Governance signals:
- are opinions, not promises
- do not imply safety or endorsement
- do not guarantee future behavior

Users must independently assess risk.

---

## 12. Summary

Initia Protocol v1 governance:
- observes rather than commands,
- records rather than enforces,
- coordinates rather than controls.

It is a **mirror of collective understanding**, not a lever of power.
