# Initia Protocol v1 — Frozen Declaration

## Status: FROZEN

This document formally declares **Initia Protocol v1** as **frozen**.

“Frozen” means that the protocol’s **core rules, guarantees, and constraints**
are fixed and will not change.

---

## 1. Scope of the Freeze

The v1 freeze applies to:

- Minting rules and eligibility logic
- Token supply mechanics
- Governance signaling scope and limitations
- Non-goals and exclusions
- Threat model assumptions
- Absence of upgradeability
- Absence of administrative control

These properties are **immutable by design**.

---

## 2. Governance Limitations

Governance in v1:
- is purely signaling and non-executable
- cannot alter protocol behavior
- cannot introduce new powers
- cannot override this freeze

Governance signals **do not** constitute amendments.

---

## 3. No Amendments, No Patches

Initia Protocol v1:
- has no amendment process
- has no emergency controls
- has no patch or hotfix mechanism

Any change to behavior requires a **new protocol version** (v2 or later),
deployed independently.

---

## 4. Relationship to Future Versions

Future versions:
- may draw inspiration from v1
- may reference v1 governance signals
- are not obligated to maintain compatibility

There is **no automatic upgrade path** from v1 to any future version.

---

## 5. User and Integrator Notice

Participants should assume:
- v1 behavior will remain exactly as deployed
- discovered flaws will not be corrected in v1
- economic or technical risks persist indefinitely

Interaction with Initia Protocol v1 is **at the user’s own risk**.

---

## 6. Purpose of Freezing

The v1 freeze exists to:
- eliminate hidden authority
- prevent expectation drift
- reduce governance capture incentives
- ensure predictable behavior
- provide a stable reference point

---

## 7. Final Statement

Initia Protocol v1 is frozen.

No individual, group, governance signal, or external actor
has the authority to modify its behavior.

All future evolution must occur through **explicitly new versions**.
